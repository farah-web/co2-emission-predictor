# 🌍 CO₂ Emission Predictor
A **machine learning regression project** that predicts vehicle CO₂ emissions based on engine specifications, transmission type, fuel type, and fuel consumption metrics.  
This project includes **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**, **model training**, and **deployment on Streamlit Cloud**.

🔗 **Live App:** [CO₂ Emission Predictor](https://co2-emission-predictor-qqnxndpkyfdcfp3pya64so.streamlit.app/)


## 📌 Project Overview
Transportation is one of the major contributors to greenhouse gas emissions worldwide.  
This project aims to:
- 🔎 Analyze vehicle CO₂ emissions dataset  
- 📈 Explore relationships between engine size, cylinders, fuel type, and emissions  
- 🤖 Train machine learning models to predict emissions  
- 🌐 Deploy an interactive **Streamlit web app** for real-time predictions
